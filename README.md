Some php code to help you save form data to a csv file on a server.

This is a code sample that will let you save a GoCanvas query in a csv file on a server.

Use it in conjunction with a CRON job and a webhook to perform another action.

My example pulls data from the past 30 minutes and saves it to a file.  If there's data a Webhook is fired.
